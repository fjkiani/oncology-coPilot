# Blockchain POC Implementation Details

This document provides specific details about the Proof-of-Concept (POC) implementation for leveraging blockchain technology within the AI Cancer Care CoPilot project. For a higher-level overview and rationale, please refer to the main [README.md](README.md).

## Goal

The primary goal of this POC is to demonstrate a secure and auditable method for logging metadata about **clinician feedback on AI-generated outputs** onto an immutable ledger, without storing any sensitive data on the blockchain itself.

## Core Concept: Off-Chain Data, On-Chain Metadata

The fundamental principle guiding this implementation is ensuring **no Protected Health Information (PHI) or sensitive data is ever stored on the blockchain.**

*   **Off-Chain:** The actual content of the contribution (e.g., the text of the feedback provided by a clinician, context about the AI output) is stored securely within our conventional, HIPAA-compliant backend systems (e.g., a secure database, conceptual for the POC).
*   **On-Chain:** Only non-sensitive **metadata** is recorded on the blockchain ledger. This includes:
    *   An identifier for the contributor (the blockchain address of the backend service logging the event).
    *   The type of contribution (e.g., `"AI_Feedback"`).
    *   The timestamp of the contribution (derived from the block timestamp).
    *   A **cryptographic hash** (e.g., SHA-256) of the off-chain data. This acts as a verifiable, unique fingerprint linking to the original data without revealing its content.

## Explaining the POC to Clinicians (Non-Technical)

When explaining this feature to clinicians or other non-technical stakeholders, focus on the value and reassurance, not the underlying mechanics.

**The Core Idea (Simple Terms):**

*   We're adding a highly secure, specialized **digital logbook**.
*   Think of it like a **tamper-proof sign-in sheet** for important interactions with the AI CoPilot, specifically when you provide feedback.

**What We're Logging in this POC:**

*   When you provide **feedback** on an AI suggestion (like a summary or a draft note), this logbook securely records *that* you gave feedback, *when* you gave it, and a unique reference code.

**Why Should You Care? (Benefits):**

1.  **Makes Your Feedback Count (Trust & Improvement):**
    *   This logbook creates a **permanent, trustworthy record** that your feedback was received and registered.
    *   It helps ensure your expert insights are systematically captured and used to **make the AI CoPilot smarter, safer, and more helpful** for you and your colleagues.
    *   It adds transparency â€“ you can be confident your contributions to improving the system are formally acknowledged.

2.  **Enhances AI Reliability Over Time (Quality & Safety):**
    *   By reliably tracking feedback (both positive and negative), we can accelerate the process of refining the AI's accuracy and usefulness.
    *   A better AI means **more reliable support for your clinical decisions**, saving you time and potentially catching things that might otherwise be missed.
    *   *(Patient Benefit):* Ultimately, a continuously improving AI assistant helps you provide higher quality, more efficient care for your patients.

**Security & HIPAA (Crucial Reassurance):**

*   **"Is My Patient's Data Going 'On The Blockchain'?" -> "Absolutely NOT."**
*   This logbook is **strictly for metadata only**. Think of it like the envelope, not the letter inside.
*   It records **ONLY**: *that* feedback occurred, *your* secure identifier (or the system's), *when* it happened, and a unique reference code (hash).
*   **Zero patient details (PHI) and zero actual feedback text** are ever stored in this logbook. All sensitive information stays securely protected within our existing HIPAA-compliant systems.
*   This logging method adds an *extra* layer of security and auditability for tracking system improvements, without ever compromising patient confidentiality.

**The Elevator Pitch:**

"Doctor, we're adding a highly secure digital log to permanently record when you provide feedback on the AI. This ensures your expertise directly helps improve the CoPilot, making it a better tool for everyone, all while keeping all patient data completely separate and safe according to HIPAA rules. It's about building trust and accelerating improvement."

## Detailed Explanation (Q&A)

Here's a breakdown of the specifics based on our previous discussion:

### What feedback is being provided?

*   In this specific POC, we're focusing on **explicit feedback from clinicians about the AI's output**.
*   *Example:* The CoPilot generates a patient summary. The doctor reads it and notices it missed a critical detail (e.g., a recent allergy). They might use a hypothetical "Provide Feedback" button/mechanism in the UI to type: *"Summary omitted the newly reported Penicillin allergy."*
*   This text, along with context (like which summary it refers to), constitutes the feedback data stored off-chain.

### How is the feedback going to improve our model *through* blockchain?

*   **Important Distinction:** The blockchain **doesn't** directly train or improve the AI model itself. Think of the blockchain as a **highly secure, immutable logbook keeper**, not the training school.
*   **The Process Works Like This:**
    1.  **Feedback Given:** Doctor submits feedback via the UI.
    2.  **Backend Receives:** The feedback text and context arrive at our backend API (`/api/feedback`).
    3.  **Secure Storage (Off-Chain):** The *actual feedback text* and context are stored securely in our regular, HIPAA-compliant database (conceptual storage for POC).
    4.  **Hashing:** The backend creates a unique digital fingerprint (SHA-256 hash) of the feedback data string.
    5.  **Blockchain Interaction (On-Chain Logging):** The backend calls the `record_contribution` utility function, which interacts with the smart contract to log the event metadata: Type=`'AI_Feedback'`, Reference Hash=`[the unique fingerprint]`, Timestamp=`[block timestamp]`, Contributor=`[backend's address]`.
    6.  **Smart Contract Records:** The `ContributionTracker` smart contract permanently records this metadata in its logbook on the blockchain ledger.
    7.  **Model Improvement (Separate, Off-Chain Process):** Later, authorized personnel or processes can:
        *   Query the secure **off-chain** database for feedback entries (potentially using the blockchain log as an **audit trail** to ensure all logged events are considered).
        *   Analyze the *actual feedback text* stored there.
        *   Use these insights to fine-tune AI models, improve prompts, or identify error patterns.
*   **Blockchain's Role:** It provides **verifiable proof** that feedback was submitted, when, and by whom (or which system component logged it). This builds trust, creates an audit trail for the improvement process, and enables tracking/incentives for providing valuable feedback, which *indirectly* fuels the model improvement cycle that happens off-chain.

### What is the smart contract mechanism or doing?

*   It's essentially a **digital registry program** (`ContributionTracker.sol`) running on the blockchain.
*   **Its Job:**
    *   Define the data structure for a log entry (the `Contribution` struct: `id`, `contributor`, `contributionType`, `referenceHash`, `timestamp`).
    *   Provide a function (`logContribution`) restricted to the contract owner (our backend service address) to add new metadata entries.
    *   Automatically record the caller's blockchain address (`msg.sender`) and the block timestamp (`block.timestamp`).
    *   Store these entries immutably.
    *   Provide a function (`getContribution`) to allow reading of logged entries by ID.
    *   Emit an event (`ContributionLogged`) whenever a new entry is successfully logged, allowing potential off-chain services to listen for these events.

### What kind of blockchain are we using / as what technology etc?

*   **For this POC:** We are using a **local development blockchain** network.
*   **Technology:**
    *   **Network:** **Hardhat Network** (A simulated Ethereum environment included with Hardhat, running locally).
    *   **Smart Contract Language:** **Solidity** (v0.8.20 or higher).
    *   **Development Tool:** **Hardhat** (Framework for compiling, deploying, testing Solidity).
    *   **Backend Library:** **Web3.py** (Python library for backend interaction with the blockchain node).
*   **Future (Beyond POC):** A production deployment would likely use a **private or consortium blockchain** (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, private Ethereum) for controlled access among trusted participants.

## Implementation Steps Summary

1.  **Hardhat Setup:** Initialized a Hardhat project in the `blockchain/` directory (`npx hardhat init`) and installed dependencies (`@openzeppelin/contracts`). *(Note: Required Node.js v18+)*.
2.  **Smart Contract:** Created `blockchain/contracts/ContributionTracker.sol` implementing the registry logic with `Ownable` access control.
3.  **Compilation:** Compiled the contract using `npx hardhat compile`.
4.  **Deployment Script:** Created `blockchain/scripts/deploy.js` using `ethers.js` (via Hardhat) to deploy the contract.
5.  **Local Node:** Started the local blockchain using `npx hardhat node` in a separate terminal.
6.  **Deployment:** Deployed the contract to the local node using `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`, obtaining the contract address.
7.  **Backend Dependency:** Installed `web3.py` in the backend environment (`pip install web3`).
8.  **Backend Utilities:** Created `backend/core/blockchain_utils.py` containing:
    *   Connection logic to the Hardhat node (RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`).
    *   Code to load the contract ABI (from `blockchain/artifacts/...`) and address.
    *   Code to load the deployer's private key from the `.env` file (`BLOCKCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY`).
    *   The `async def record_contribution(contribution_type, data_to_log)` function to hash data and send a transaction to the `logContribution` contract function.
9.  **Environment Variable:** Added `BLOCKCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY` (copied from Hardhat node output) to the `.env` file in the project root.
10. **API Endpoint:** Added a `POST /api/feedback/{patient_id}` endpoint to `backend/main.py` that receives feedback, conceptually stores it off-chain, and calls `record_contribution` from the blockchain utilities.
11. **Testing:** Manually tested the flow using `curl` (or Swagger UI) to send data to the `/api/feedback` endpoint and verifying successful transaction logs in the backend and Hardhat node terminals.
