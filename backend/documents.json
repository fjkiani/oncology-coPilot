Capivasertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Prostate specific antigen or estrogen can cause the growth of tumor cells. Hormone therapy using enzalutamide or fulvestrant may fight prostate or breast cancer by blocking the use of prostate specific antigen or estrogen by the tumor cells. Capivasertib with or without enzalutamide or fulvestrant may work better in treating patients with solid tumor with AKT1, AKT2, or AKT3 mutations.\n\n## Eligibility Criteria\n\n### Inclusion Criteria\n\n- Pathologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic advanced solid tumor, for which there is no curative-intent treatment option and confirmation of the presence of AKT1, AKT2, or AKT3 mutations detected by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering (MSK)-integrated mutation profiling of actionable cancer targets (IMPACT) assay platform or other Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-approved test\n- Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients must have received and progressed on fulvestrant and be post-menopausal\n- Prostate cancer patients must have received and progressed on enzalutamide\n- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =< 2 with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks\n- Life expectancy of >= 12 weeks\n- Measurable disease as defined by the tumor specific relevant response criteria for the breast and other solid tumor cohorts (measurable disease is not required for enrollment in the prostate cancer cohort):\n\\\\* RECIST version 1.1 criteria\n\\\\* Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria\n\\\\* RANO criteria\n- Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures, should not be breast feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of child-bearing potential or must have evidence of non-child-bearing potential by fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening:\n\\\\* Post-menopausal defined as:\n\\\\*\\\\* Aged more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least 12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments\n\\\\*\\\\* Estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in post-menopausal range while receiving gonadotrophin releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues for medical castration in patients with breast cancer\n\\\\* Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation\n- Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception (i.e. condoms)\n\n### Exclusion Criteria\n\n- ER+ breast cancer patients harboring the AKT1 E17K mutation (patient population tested in MSK IRB# 14-214, study D3610C00001 part E, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01226316)\n- Diabetes mellitus type 1\n- Fasting plasma glucose (fasting is defined as no calorific intake for at least 8 hours):\n\\\\* >= 126 mg/dL for those patients without a pre-existing diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus\n\\\\* >= 167 mg/dL for those patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus\n- Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) >= 8.0%\n- Requirement for insulin for routine diabetic management and control\n- Requirement for > 2 oral hypoglycemic medications for routine diabetic management and control\n- Treatment with any of the following:\n\\\\* Any investigational agents or study drugs from a previous clinical study within 30 days of the first dose of study treatment\n\\\\* Any other chemotherapy, immunotherapy or anticancer agents within 3 weeks or 5 half lives, whichever is longer, of the first dose of study treatment, except fulvestrant, enzalutamide or hormonal therapy with LHRH analogues for medical castration in patients with breast or prostate cancer, which are permitted\n\\\\* Potent inhibitors or inducers or substrates of CYP3A4 or substrates of CYP2D6 within 2 weeks before the first dose of study treatment (3 weeks for St John's wort)\n\\\\* Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment\n\\\\* Radiotherapy with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment\n\\\\* Prior ATP-competitive AKT inhibitors\n- With the exception of alopecia, any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 1 at the time of starting study treatment\n- Spinal cord compression or brain metastases unless asymptomatic, treated and stable and not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment\n- As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including active bleeding diatheses, or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus;

To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of capivasertib (AZD5363) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring mutations in AKT1, AKT2, or AKT3, by evaluation of tumor response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1, the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3), Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement as applicable.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) (complete response, partial response, or stable disease) at 24 weeks according to according to RECIST v1.1, PCWG3, or RANO as applicable, in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring mutations in AKT1, AKT2, or AKT3.\n\nII. Progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST v1.1, PCWG3, or RANO as applicable.\n\nIII. Confirm tolerability of AZD5363.\n\nIV. Estimate the proportion of patients without PSA progression by PCWG3 criteria at 24 weeks. (Prostate Cohort)\n\nV. Determine the 12 week PSA response rate (RR). (Prostate Cohort)\n\nVI. Evaluate PSA-PFS by PCWG3 criteria. (Prostate Cohort)\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Examine the clonality and genetic configuration of the AKT sensitizing mutation in the pretreatment specimens of study patients and their associated clinical response to AZD5363.\n\nII. Examine the pattern of co-mutated genes in AKT-mutant tumors and their association with treatment response or resistance.\n\nIII. Describe possible mechanisms of acquired resistance to AKT inhibition.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I: Patients with prostate cancer previously treated with enzalutamide receive capivasertib (PO) twice daily (BID) with 4 days on and 3 days off and enzalutamide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.\n\nCOHORT II: Patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer previously treated with fulvestrant receive capivasertib as in Cohort I and fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of subsequent cycles.

It targets the B-cell lymphoma 2\n(BCL-2) protein, which supports cancer cell growth and is overexpressed in many patients\nwith follicular lymphoma. Venetoclax may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may\ncause cancer cells to die.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see whether adding venetoclax to obinutuzumab and\nbendamustine improves the response (the tumor shrinks or disappears) in patients with\nfollicular lymphoma.\n\nAs of 9/5/2018, a higher than expected incidence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) was\nexperienced among patients receiving venetoclax, obinutuzumab and bendamustine on Cycle\n1, Day 1 of treatment. TLS is caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells. These\npatients developed an increase in some of their blood tests (uric acid, phosphorus,\npotassium and/or creatinine). They received a medication called rasburicase and continued\nwith treatment. It is unclear if the TLS was due to the venetoclax or the standard\ntreatment of obinutuzumab and bendamustine. For the remaining patients, venetoclax will\nstart on Cycle 2, Day 1 (previously Cycle 1, Day 1).\n\nAs of 9/16/2021, additional maintenance therapy has been suspended for those patients who\nremain on study. These patients will not receive any further treatment and will move on\nto the two year survival follow-up.\n\n## Eligibility Criteria\n\n### Inclusion Criteria\n\n- \\- Patient must have a histologically confirmed (biopsy-proven) diagnosis of follicular\nB-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (WHO classification: follicular center grades 1, 2, and\n3a \\[3b patients are not eligible\\]), with no evidence of transformation to large cell\nhistology.\n\n\\- Patient must meet criteria for High Tumor Burden (higher risk) as defined by either\nthe Groupe D'Etude des Lymphomes Follicularies (GELF) criteria \\[at least one\\\ncriterion\\] OR the follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) \\[score\\\nof 3, 4, or 5\\].\n\n\\- Patient must have Stage II, III or IV disease.\n\n\\- Baseline measurements and evaluations (PET/ CT) must be obtained within 10 weeks of\nrandomization to the study. Patient must have at least one objective measurable\ndisease parameter.\n\n\\- Age ≥ 18 years.\n\n\\- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.\n\n\\- Ability to understand and willingness to sign Institutional Review Board\n(IRB)-approved informed consent.\n\n\\- Willing to provide mandatory tissue samples (if sufficient tissue available) for\nresearch purposes.\n\n\\- Adequate organ function as measured by the following criteria:\n\n\\- Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1000/mm³\n\n\\- Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL\n\n\\- Platelets ˃75,000/mm³\n\n\\- Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min, calculated with the use of 24-hour creatinine\nclearance or by Cockcroft-Gault formula\n\n\\- Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) or ≤ 3x ULN for patients\nwith documented Gilbert's syndrome\n\n\\- Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5x ULN\n\n\\- Alkaline Phosphatase <5x ULN\n\n\\- All females of childbearing potential (not surgically sterilized and between\nmenarche and 1 year post menopause) must have a blood or urine test to rule out\npregnancy within 2 weeks prior to registration.\n\n\\- Women must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n\\- Patient must have had no prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy for\nlymphoma. For purposes of this trial, prednisone or other corticosteroids used for\nnon-lymphomatous conditions will not be considered as prior chemotherapy. In\naddition, a prior/recent short course (<2 weeks) of steroids for symptom relief of\nlymphoma-related symptoms will not make a patient ineligible.\n\n\\- Patient must have no recent history of malignancy except for adequately treated\nbasal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, Stage I melanoma of the skin, or in situ\ncervical cancer. Individuals in documented remission without treatment for ≥ 2 years\nprior to enrollment may be included at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n\\- Patient must have no active, uncontrolled infections.\n\n\\- Patients must be tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis B surface antigen\n(HBsAg+) and hepatitis C (HCV) antibody within 6 weeks of registration. Patients who\nare chronic carriers of HBV with positive HBsAg+ and positive HCV serology are\nexcluded, as chemotherapy and B-cell depleting therapy have been associated with\nvirus reactivation and fulminant hepatitis. NOTE: Patients with a past or resolved\nHBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody \\[anti-HBc\\] and\nabsence of HBsAg) may be included if HBV DNA is undetectable. If enrolled, patients\nmust be willing to undergo monthly HBV DNA testing. Patients with positive HCV\nantibody must be negative for HCV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to be eligible\nfor study participation.\n\n\\- HIV positive patients are not excluded, but to enroll, must meet all of the below\ncriteria:\n\n\\- HIV is sensitive to antiretroviral therapy.\n\n\\- Must be willing to take effective antiretroviral therapy if indicated.\n\n\\- No history of CD4 prior to or at the time of lymphoma diagnosis <300 cells/mm³.\n\n\\- No history of AIDS-defining conditions.\n\n\\- If on antiretroviral therapy, must not be taking zidovudine or stavudine.\n\n\\- Must be willing to take prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia during\ntherapy and until at least 2 months following the completion of therapy or\nuntil the CD4 cells recover to over 250 cells/mm³, whichever occurs later.\n\n\\- Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases that could affect\ncompliance with the protocol or interpretation of results or that could increase\nrisk to the patient.\n\n\\- No major surgery within 2 weeks prior to cycle 1, other than for diagnosis.\n\n\\- A condition that precludes oral route of administration (venetoclax).\n\n\\- No known allergies to both xanthine oxidase inhibitors and rasburicase.\n\n\\- Patient must not require the use of warfarin (because of potential drug-drug\ninteractions that may potentially increase the exposure of warfarin). Blood thinners\nof other classes are permitted.\n\n\\- Patient may not receive the following agents within 7 days prior to the first dose\nof venetoclax:\n\n\\- Strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors\n\n\\- Strong and moderate CYP3A inducers\n\n\\- Consumed grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade\ncontaining Seville oranges), or star fruit within 3 days prior to the first\ndose of venetoclax.\n\n\\- Patient must not have serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere\nwith participation in this clinical study.\n\n## Locations & Contacts\n\nState:AllGeorgiaMaryland\n\nLocations matching your search criteria\n\n### United States\n\n#### Georgia\n\n##### Atlanta\n\n**Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital**\n\nStatus: Active\n\nContact: Jonathon B.

The survival rates\n\nfor patients with indolent NHL remained unchanged from the 1950s through the early 1990s,\n\nbut recent evidence suggests that outcomes continue to improve. High-risk patients with\n\nFL, defined as having advanced stage and high tumor burden have significantly shorter\n\nprogression free survival despite significant advances.\n\nThis is an open-label phase II study of venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab and\n\nbendamustine. Patients will receive induction therapy with obinutuzumab and bendamustine\n\nfor six cycles (1 cycle = 28 days). Venetoclax will start with 2nd cycle of induction\n\ntherapy (previously started with cycle 1). There will be a formal, detailed toxicity\n\nevaluation after 21 patients complete 3 cycles of treatment.\n\nPatients who achieve partial response or stable disease will receive therapy with\n\nobinutuzumab every 2 months for 12 cycles and venetoclax every month for 24 cycles.\n\nPatients who achieve a complete response will receive obinutuzumab every 2 months for 12\n\ncycles. Patients with progressive disease will not continue onto the maintenance arm.\n\nTumor assessments will be performed approximately every 12 weeks during induction and\n\nevery 6 months during maintenance therapy.\n\nMandatory pre-treatment tumor tissue sample (i.e., obtained during a previous procedure\n\nor biopsy) will be required for research (if sufficient tissue is available). Optional\n\ntumor biopsy samples obtained during treatment or post-treatment will also be requested\n\nfor research.\n\n## Trial Phase & Type\n\n**Trial Phase** Phase II\n\n**Trial Type** treatment\n\n## Lead Organization\n\n**Lead Organization** PrECOG, LLC\n\n## Trial IDs\n\n- **Primary ID** PrE0403\n- **Secondary IDs** NCI-2017-01579, ML39161\n- **ClinicalTrials.gov ID** [NCT03113422](http://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03113422)\n\nShare this clinical trial with your doctor:\n\nPrint this trialEmail this trial\n\n[**Have a question?

However, as noted above, drug-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria specified in the protocol appendix for each agent will take precedence for this and all inclusion criteria:\n- Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 106/µl\n- Hemoglobin > 9.0 g/dl\n- Platelets > 75,000/µl\n- Total bilirubin < 2.0 mg/ dl, except in patients with Gilbert's Syndrome\n- Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) < 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (or < 5 x ULN in patients with known hepatic metastases)\n- Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN or calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2\n- Patients must have disease that can be objectively measured by physical or radiographic exam (per RECIST v1.1 for solid tumor, Lugano criteria for non-Hodgkin lymphoma or International Myeloma Working Group criteria for multiple myeloma), defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or a subcutaneous or superficial lesion that can be measured with calipers by clinical exam. For lymph nodes, the short axis must be ≥15 mm. Patient's whose disease cannot be objectively measured by physical or radiographic examination (e.g., elevated serum tumor marker only, bone-only disease without an identifiable soft tissue component, or patients with only assessable non-measurable disease) are NOT eligible.\n- Results must be available from a genomic test or immunohistochemistry (IHC) test for protein expression performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified and College of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited or New York State accredited (for labs offering services to residents of NY) laboratory. Labs that have registered the test with the NIH Genetic Testing Registry or that provide a report that has been designated as optimized for TAPUR participation are preferred, but not required. The genomic or IHC test used to qualify a patient for participation in TAPUR may have been performed on any specimen of the patient's tumor obtained at any point during the patient's care at the discretion of the patient's treating physician. Genomic assays performed on cell-free DNA in plasma (\"liquid biopsies\") will also be acceptable if the genomic analysis is performed in a laboratory that meets the criteria described above.\n- Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent/assent document.\n- Have a tumor genomic profile for which single agent treatment with one of the FDA approved targeted anti-cancer drugs included in this study has potential clinical benefit based on the criteria described in protocol.\n- For orally administered drugs, the patient must be able to swallow and tolerate oral medication and must have no known malabsorption syndrome.\n- Because of the risks of drug treatment to the developing fetus, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation, and for four months following completion of study therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study or if she is the partner of a male participant in this study and becomes pregnant while he is participating in this study, she should inform her or her partner's treating physician immediately as well as her obstetrician. Female study patients who become pregnant must immediately discontinue treatment with any study therapy. Male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner. Male study patients, even if surgically sterilized, (i.e. post-vasectomy) must agree to one of the following: practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and for a specified amount of time the last dose of study drug, or completely abstain from sexual intercourse. Note: TAPUR does not explicitly exclude any type of solid tumor, but the patient must\nhave measurable and evaluable disease per RECIST v1.1.\n\n### Exclusion Criteria\n\n- Patients whose disease is not measurable or cannot be assessed by radiographic imaging or physical examination (e.g., elevated serum tumor marker only) are not eligible\n- Patients with primary brain tumors or leptomeningeal metastases are excluded.\n- Patients with previously treated brain metastases are eligible, provided that the patient has not experienced a seizure or had a clinically significant change in neurological status within the 3 months prior to registration. All patients with previously treated brain metastases must be clinically stable for at least 1 month after completion of treatment and off steroid treatment for one month prior to study enrollment.\n- Patients with known progressive brain metastases are eligible but additional eligibility criteria apply.

Many studies have shown that women who are overweight or obese when diagnosed with breast cancer appear to have a higher risk of cancer recurrence. This study aims to test whether overweight or obese women who take part in a weight loss program after being diagnosed with breast cancer have a lower rate of cancer recurrence as compared to women who do not take part in the program.\n\n## Eligibility Criteria\n\n### Inclusion Criteria\n\n- Subjects must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer and registration must occur within 16 months after the first histologic diagnosis of invasive breast cancer\n\\\\* A core biopsy interpreted as invasive cancer meets this criterion; if no core biopsy is performed, the date of first histologic diagnosis will be the date of first surgical procedure that identifies invasive cancer (biopsy, lumpectomy or mastectomy)\n\\\\* Neoadjuvant subjects should have no evidence of clinical T4 disease prior to chemotherapy and surgery; eligibility for neoadjuvant patients can be defined by either clinical stage prior to therapy or pathologic stage at surgery; if patient is eligible based on either, they are eligible for the study\n\\\\* Bilateral breast carcinoma is allowed provided either:\n\\\\*\\\\* Diagnoses are synchronous – that is, within 3 months of one another – and at least one of the two breast carcinomas meet the eligibility criteria and neither is Her-2 positive or inflammatory; OR\n\\\\*\\\\* The contralateral breast cancer was at least 5 years prior to the current diagnosis\n\\\\* No evidence of metastatic or locally recurrent disease\n- Her-2 negative, defined as:\n\\\\* In-situ hybridization (ISH) ratio of < 2.0 (if performed)\n\\\\* Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of 0-2 positive (+) (if performed)\n\\\\* Deemed to not be a candidate for Her-2 directed therapy\n- Eligible tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages include:\n\\\\* Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negative (defined as < 1% staining for ER and PR by IHC): T2 or T3 N0, T0-3N1-3\n\\\\*\\\\* Note: Patients with T0N0, T1N0 and T1N1mi disease, and patients with T4 disease, are NOT eligible\n\\\\* ER and/or PR positive (defined as >= 1% staining for ER and/or PR on IHC): T0-3N1-3 or T3N0\n\\\\*\\\\* Note: Patients with T0N0, T1N0, T2N0, T1N1mi and T2N1mi disease, and patients with T4 disease, are NOT eligible\nThe eligibility of neo-adjuvant subjects can be assessed on the basis of clinical (c)TNM or pathologic (yp)TNM; the same eligible TNM combinations apply; patients may be eligible if they meet eligibility requirements at either time point, as long as they do not have T4 disease prior to therapy\n- No history of invasive breast cancer in 5 years prior to study registration other than the current diagnosis (prior ductal breast carcinoma in situ \\[DCIS\\] at any time does not make a patient ineligible)\n- Patients must have had a bilateral mammogram within 16 months prior to registration, unless the initial surgery was a total mastectomy, in which case only a mammogram of the remaining breast is required; (subjects with bilateral total mastectomies do not require imaging)\n- Investigations, including chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) chest, bone scan (with radiographs of suspicious areas) and abdominal ultrasound or liver scan or CT abdomen have been performed between the first histologic diagnosis and the time of registration as detailed below\n\\\\* Chest X-ray, 2 view (or chest CT, or positron emission tomography \\[PET\\]/CT) is required only if clinically indicated or recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines\n\\\\* Bone scans (with x-rays of abnormal areas) are required only if indicated or recommended by NCCN guidelines\n\\\\* Abdominal imaging is required only if clinically indicated or recommended by NCCN guidelines\n- PRIOR TREATMENT\n- All adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery completed at least 21 days prior to registration\n\\\\* All triple negative patients must receive chemotherapy of the treating physician’s choice\n\\\\* ER/PR+ patients must receive chemotherapy (of the treating physician’s choice) unless Oncotype Dx or another genomic predictor score indicates that they are at low or intermediate risk of disease recurrence with endocrine therapy alone\n\\\\* Patients may have breast reconstruction during protocol participation, but definitive breast cancer surgery must be completed at least 21 days prior to registration\n\\\\*\\\\* Concomitant biologic therapy, hormonal therapy, and bisphosphonates are acceptable\n- Surgical margins must be clear of invasive carcinoma; if there is microscopic residual ductal in situ disease present at lumpectomy or total mastectomy margins, further excision is highly recommended; if further excision is not undertaken, the subject may still be entered on study, provided that in addition to breast or chest wall irradiation, a boost to the tumor bed is delivered; in situ lobular disease at the margin is acceptable\n- All subjects (both adjuvant and neoadjuvant) must have sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or axillary lymph node dissection, as per pre-specified institutional guidelines\n- All women who undergo breast conserving therapy must receive concomitant radiotherapy; radiation after mastectomy is to be administered according to pre-specified institutional guidelines; radiation must be completed at least 21 days prior to registration\n- Patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer as defined above must plan to receive at least 5 years of adjuvant hormonal therapy in the form of tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, alone or in combination with ovarian suppression; (NOTE: for patients with ER and PR staining in less than 5% of cells, hormonal therapy for at least 5 years is strongly recommended but not required); hormonal therapy can be initiated prior to or during protocol therapy\n- Age >= 18 years\n- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1\n- COMORBID CONDITIONS\n- No history of other malignancy within the past 4 years, except for malignancies with a > 95% likelihood of cure (e.g. non-melanoma skin cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, in situ cervical cancer); patients cannot have metastatic breast or other cancer\n- No diabetes mellitus currently treated with insulin or sulfonylureas\n- No history of serious digestive and/or absorptive problems, including inflammatory bowel disease and chronic diarrhea that preclude adherence to the study diet\n- No history of severe cardiovascular, respiratory or musculoskeletal disease or joint problems that preclude moderate physical activity; examples would include unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, oxygen-dependent pulmonary disease, and osteoarthritis requiring imminent joint replacement; moderate arthritis that does not preclude physical activity is not a reason for ineligibility\n- No prior bariatric surgery or planning to undergo this procedure within the next 2 years after study registration\n- No use of weight loss medications (with the exception of metformin) at the time of study enrollment or plans to take these agents within the next 2 years after study enrollment\n- No comorbid conditions that would cause life expectancy of less than 5 years\n- No history of psychiatric disorders that would preclude participation in the study intervention (e.g. untreated major depression or psychosis, substance abuse, severe personality disorder) or prevent the patient from giving informed consent\n- No chronic (>= 1 month) use of oral steroids at the time of study enrollment; inhaled or topical steroids are acceptable; patients previously taking oral steroids are required to undergo a 30-day washout prior to registration\n- BMI >= 27 kg/m^2 documented within 56 days prior to study registration; the most recent BMI obtained within that window must be used for eligibility; if most recent BMI is < 27 then the patient is not eligible to enroll\n- Self-reported ability to walk at least 2 blocks (at any pace)\n- Not participating in another weight loss, physical activity or dietary intervention clinical trial; co-enrollment in some trials involving pharmacologic therapy is allowed; participants in both arms are also allowed to pursue weight loss and physical activity programs on their own, as long as these programs are not provided as part of a clinical trial\n- Able to read and comprehend spoken English or Spanish\n\\\\* Eligibility is restricted to individuals who can comprehend and read English or Spanish given that participation in the study will require the ability to read lifestyle intervention materials and communicate with a coach through 42 phone calls over 2 years; the trial is unable to accommodate the needs of deaf participants as the study relies on spoken language to provide coaching\n\n## Locations & Contacts\n\nSee trial information on [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02750826) for a list of participating sites.\n\n## Trial Objectives and Outline\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI.

To evaluate the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1 overall response rate (ORR) in subsets of patients with advanced rare cancers treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination immunotherapy.\n\nII. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with gestational trophoblastic tumors treated with ipilimumab plus nivolumab combination immunotherapy.\n\nIII. To evaluate the RECIST v1.1 overall response rate (ORR) in patients PD-L1 amplified cancers treated with nivolumab immunotherapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate toxicities in each cohort.\n\nII. To estimate overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit rate; and to estimate immune related (i)RECIST ORR (iORR), and iRECIST PFS (iPFS) across cohorts and within each cohort.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I (ALL COHORTS EXCEPT THE PD-L1 AMPLIFIED COHORT): Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and ipilimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 17 cycles (2 years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who complete 17 cycles (2 years) of therapy, may continue receiving the same treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab, or receive nivolumab once every 14 or 28 days (2 weeks or 4 weeks) per physician discretion in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who stop treatment prior to the completion of 17 cycles of therapy may receive nivolumab once every 14 or 28 days (2 weeks or 4 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo echocardiography (ECHO) during screening and on study. Patients also undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) throughout the trial. Additionally, patients undergo blood sample collection throughout the trial.\n\nARM II (PD-L1 AMPLIFIED COHORT): Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 15 and 29. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 17 cycles (2 years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 17 cycles (2 years) of therapy, patients may receive nivolumab once every 14 or 28 days (2 weeks or 4 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo ECHO during screening and on study. Patients also undergo MRI or CT throughout the trial. Additionally, patients undergo blood sample collection throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 10 years from registration.\n\n## Trial Phase & Type\n\n**Trial Phase** Phase II\n\n**Trial Type** treatment\n\n## Lead Organization\n\n**Lead Organization** SWOG\n\n**Principal Investigator** Sandip Pravin Patel\n\n## Trial IDs\n\n- **Primary ID** S1609\n- **Secondary IDs** NCI-2016-01041\n- **ClinicalTrials.gov ID** [NCT02834013](http://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02834013)\n\nShare this clinical trial with your doctor:\n\nPrint this trialEmail this trial\n\n[**Have a question?

Venous clots in the legs\n\nare called deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and are dangerous because they travel to the\n\nlungs where they cause blockages known as pulmonary emboli (PE). DVT and PE are called\n\nvenous thromboemboli (VTE). Cancer is a risk factor with nearly 200,000 VTEs in cancer\n\npatients each year. The purpose of VTE treatment is to prevent the initial clot from\n\nspreading and to prevent new clots from forming. This is accomplished by thinning the\n\nblood, or anticoagulation. Without anticoagulation, VTEs recur and are often fatal.\n\nRecently, the FDA has approved 4 new Direct Oral AntiCoagulants (DOACs) for preventing\n\nVTE recurrence. Few cancer patients were included in the efficacy trials, and practice\n\nguidelines fall silent on whether switching to DOAC therapy is advisable. To fill this\n\nknowledge gap, the Alliance Foundation Trials LLC, a research network of academic and\n\ncommunity practices across the US, is conducting a pragmatic randomized effectiveness\n\ntrial.\n\nThe overarching objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of LMWH/\n\nwarfarin vs. DOAC anticoagulation for preventing recurrent VTE in cancer patients. The\n\ninvestigators will conduct a trial of 811 cancer patients followed for 6 months. The\n\nintervention strategy is DOAC therapy with edoxaban, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or\n\ndabigatran. The comparator is LMWH alone or with warfarin. Within each arm, patients can\n\nchoose the agent they prefer based on side effects, drug interactions, and practical\n\nissues such as co-pays. The trial compares these two strategies in terms of treatment: 1)\n\nbenefits based on VTE recurrence; 2) harms based on bleeding rates; 3) burdens based on\n\npatients' reports of their experiences; and 4) mortality rates.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that the benefits, harms and burdens of DOAC treatment will\n\nbe non-inferior to, or better than, usual care with LMWH/ warfarin among cancer patients.\n\nThe information gained will empower cancer patients and physicians to make more informed\n\nchoices about anticoagulation strategies to manage VTE.\n\n## Trial Phase & Type\n\n**Trial Phase** No phase specified\n\n**Trial Type** treatment\n\n## Lead Organization\n\n**Lead Organization** Alliance Foundation Trials, LLC.\n\n## Trial IDs\n\n- **Primary ID** AFT-28\n- **Secondary IDs** NCI-2017-00200, CER-1503-29805\n- **ClinicalTrials.gov ID** [NCT02744092](http://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02744092)\n\nShare this clinical trial with your doctor:\n\nPrint this trialEmail this trial\n\n[**Have a question?

This trial will study the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor\nactivity of ciforadenant as a single agent and in combination with atezolizumab, a PD-L1\ninhibitor against various solid tumors. Ciforadenant blocks adenosine from binding to the\nA2A receptor. Adenosine suppresses the anti-tumor activity of T cells and other immune\ncells.\n\n## Eligibility Criteria\n\n### Inclusion Criteria\n\n- Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2.\n- Documented pathologic diagnosis of clear cell RCC.\n- Relapsed or refractory to 1-2 prior lines of therapy containing at least an anti-PD-(L)1 agent.\n- Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1\n- Mandatory newly collected tumor biopsy sample obtained prior to treatment initiation. Renal Cell Carcinoma\n\n### Exclusion Criteria\n\n- History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to monoclonal antibodies.\n- Has immunodeficiency or requires treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medication within 2 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment or anticipation of need for systemic immunosuppressant medication during study treatment.\n- Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment with in the past 2 years OR a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease.
